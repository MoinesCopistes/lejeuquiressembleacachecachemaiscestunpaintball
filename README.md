This game is a multiplayer hunting experience! ðŸŽ¯  

Press **Z** to move in the direction of your mouse. As the hunter, you can shoot, but you wonâ€™t be able to see your enemies directly. However, you can fire **paintballs** with the **left click**, marking opponents with paint. Once you spot them, use the **right click** to take them down with a stab.  

Sound plays a crucial role tooâ€”**3D audio footprints** help you track enemies by listening to their movements.  

To keep things fresh, the **map is procedurally generated**, ensuring endless replayability!

When you launch the game, you can either simply try by going solo, or creating
a server and then wait for your friends to log in. (The port is 8080 by default.)

Inside the menus, to change of focused text input, press Tab.

Keys:
